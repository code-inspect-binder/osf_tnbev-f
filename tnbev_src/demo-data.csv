1,"A. HCl and H2O are making a hydrogen bonds. The Water is sharing a lone pair with the Hydrogen in the HCl, disbonding the HCl and bonding that hydrogen to the oxygen. The Hydrogen gives the extra bond to the Cl in the form of a lone pair. 

B. This occurs because the reaction always towards making conjugate acids and bases. With H2O being the base, HCl being the acid, H3O+ being the conjugate acid and Cl- being the conjugate base."
2,The electron pair from the oxygen will bond to the H in the HCl and then the Cl will leave forming hydromium ion and chloride ion.  This occurs because there is a large difference in the polarity between H and Cl so it is favorable for the H to form a bond with the O. The Cl is a good leaving group so it will form a stable anion on its own since it is a halogen. The hydronium is relatively stable since the formal charge rests on the most electronegative atom. 
3,"Water is being protonated from the HBr, Br is the leaving group where as water is the nucleophile. H3O+ and Br are formed as the products. This reaction occurs because an acid needs to be formed."
